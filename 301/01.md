## Component-Based Architecture

**What is a “component”?**  
A component is a small, reusable piece of code that is used in React.

**What are the characteristics of a component?**  
They are both reusable and replacable. They can be used in different scenarios, and not specific to particular contexts. They can be extended to present new behaviours and they can work independently from other components. They also do not give access to the internal workings of the app.

**What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?**  
Advantages include the fact that it is *easier to make changes or replace existing components* when updates are available, and it can also be *cheaper* to use third party components. Componenents are *reusable* and can be used across different pages or even apps or websites. Using components are *reliable* and can allow *development* and *changes* without it affecting other parts of the system. Components are *independent and flexible*. 

## What is Props and How to Use it in React

**What is “props” short for?**  
Properties.

**How are props used in React?**  
Props are passed into components as arguments, which can then be used as attributes when invoking the component.

**What is the flow of props?**  
Props flow down to the children of parent elements.
