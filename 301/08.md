## API Design Best Practices

**What does REST stand for?**  
Representational State Transfer.

**REST APIs are designed around a ____.**  
Resource - that is any object, data or server that the client can access.

**What is an identifier of a resource? Give an example.**  
An identifier is a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that can uniquely identify a resource.
An example of this (for a customer order) is: 

>https://adventure-works.com/orders/1

**What are the most common HTTP verbs?**  
- GET
- POST
- PUT
- PATCH
- DELETE

>- GET retrieves a representation of the resource at the specified URI. The body of the response message contains the details of the requested resource.
>- POST creates a new resource at the specified URI. The body of the request message provides the details of the new resource. Note that POST can also be used to trigger operations that don't actually create resources.
>- PUT either creates or replaces the resource at the specified URI. The body of the request message specifies the resource to be created or updated.
>- PATCH performs a partial update of a resource. The request body specifies the set of changes to apply to the resource.
>- DELETE removes the resource at the specified URI. - [API Design Best Practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design)

**What should the URIs be based on?**  
URI's should be based on the nouns(or resources), rather than the verbs(the operations on the resource).

**Give an example of a good URI.**  
https://adventure-works.com/orders

**What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?**  
A 'chatty' API is when lots of requests need to be sent to get all the information that is needed from a resource. It is not a good thing.

**What status code does a successful GET request return?**  
HTTP status code: 200 (OK)

**What status code does an unsuccessful GET request return?**  
404 (Not Found) or  204 (No Content)

**What status code does a successful POST request return?**  
HTTP status code: 201 (Created)

**What status code does a successful DELETE request return?**  
HTTP status code: 204 (No Content)
