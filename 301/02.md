## React lifecycle

**Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?**  
'render' happens before ‘componentDidMount’.

**What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?**  
The mounting phase is the first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React. The first thing to happen in the mounting phase, is constructor() is called.

**Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates**  
1. constructor
2. render
3. React Updates
4. componentDidMount
5. componentWillUnmount

**What does componentDidMount do?**  
componentDidMount executes the code for the components that have been mounted.

## React State Vs Props

**What types of things can you pass in the props?**  
We can pass any data type through props that does not need to change or be updated. For example, you may want to pass a title and a description or initial data such as an initial number for a counter.

**What is the big difference between props and state?**  
Props are used outside of a component, where as state is used inside a component. Props are used to pass data that does not need to change, or to initialise data where as state to manage data inside the component that does need to change or be updated. For teh coutner example above, you would use state inside the component to change or increment the initial count that has been passed through.
State can be used to update and re-render the application - this could be done when the user does something or based on user input.

**When do we re-render our application?**  
When you change state within your application, that section is then re-rendered.

**What are some examples of things that we could store in state?**  
We could store a counter in state, with the counter being updated. State is also useful to use with forms, such as when a user is inputting data into the form.
