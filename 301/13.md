**What’s the relationship between REST and CRUD?**

> "REST uses the HTTP protocol’s request types (POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE) to allow users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) via an API." - [How does CRUD relate to a REST API?](https://codebots.com/crud/how-does-crud-relate-to-a-rest-api)

**If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?**

1. First you need to build the data/resources. For example, if you were building an API for movies, you may want the data for teh title, the director, the year it was made and the cast.
2. Next you need to make your endpoints which you will use for your request methods. For teh movie example, you may have an endpoint of /movies.
3. Thirdly, you need to decide and make the HTTP/CRUD methods you are going to use (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc).
4. Then, you need to write the code or "controller logic" to handle the requests you are using.
5. Finally, you need to test all your methods work and then you can deploy your API.
