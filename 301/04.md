## React Docs - Forms

**What is a ‘Controlled Component’?**
A 'controlled component' is when a component uses 'state' to handle data. In controlled components, React is in charge of managing and setting the state.

**Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.**
There are pros and cons to both ways; however by updating responses as soon as the user enters them, it allows there to be feedback before the user submits e.g. if a password doesn't contain the correct characters. React will already have the data from the user, so it can request further input based on a previous answer such as the ages of children for a booking. It also means conditions can be set before a user submits, such as agreeing to terms and conditions. - [Work With Forms in React](https://www.sitepoint.com/work-with-forms-in-react/). 

**How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?**
To target the user input when using an event handler, you need to use 'event.target.value' with the value being the data the user has input.

## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained

**Why would we use a ternary operator?**
A ternary is a shorter way of writing an if statement, with the conditional being either True or False (Boolean). It means we can do the same thing as an if statement, while writing less code.

**Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:**

>if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}

x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false);
