# Tech Educators Fullstack Developer Course

My name is Katy and I am currently completing a Full Stack MERN bootcamp with Tech Educators.  
My previous experience includes working as a Teaching Assistant and supporting people with additional needs.  
In the future, I would love to combine my passion for Web Development and Education by working on projects that support learning and those with additional needs. 

My hobbies include musical theatre, travelling and reading.
