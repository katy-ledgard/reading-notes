## Lab: 01b - Learning Markdown Example Module

### What is a growth mindset?

A growth mindset is used to desribe the way you think about your abilities and how we learn. It is believing that you can learn and develop on your talents and skills, rather than believing these stay the same and cannot change (known as a fixed mindset). Growth mindset is believing that you can learn and improve by working hard, not giving up, learning from mistakes and embracing different strategies and ways to learn.

### A little about me

My name is Katy and I am currently completing a Full Stack MERN bootcamp with Tech Educators.  
My previous experience includes working as a Teaching Assistant and supporting people with additional needs.  
I am looking to change careers and to become a Junior Developer. In the future, I would love to combine my passion for Web Development and Education by working on projects that support learning and those with additional needs. 

My other hobbies and interests include:
- Musical Theatre
