### A little about me

My name is Katy and I am currently completing a Full Stack MERN bootcamp with Tech Educators.  
My previous experience includes working as a Teaching Assistant and supporting people with additional needs.  
I am looking to change careers and to become a Junior Developer. In the future, I would love to combine my passion for Web Development and Education by working on projects that support learning and those with additional needs. 

My other hobbies and interests include:
- Musical Theatre
