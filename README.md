## Lab: 01b - Learning Markdown Example Module

### What is a growth mindset?

A growth mindset is used to desribe the way you think about your abilities and how we learn. It is believing that you can learn and develop on your talents and skills, rather than believing these will stay the same and cannot change (known as a fixed mindset). Growth mindset is believing that you can learn and improve by working hard, not giving up, learning from mistakes and embracing different strategies and ways to learn.

### How do you keep yourself in a growth mindset?

1. **Remember your improvements** - Think about where you started, how far you have come and remember all the things you have acheived so far! Reflect on previous struggles and experience and remind yourself that you were able to overcome this to get to where you are now.
2. **Ask for Feedback** - ask for feedback, regardless of the outcome of your attempts. This will help you to learn what you did well and what areas you can improve. This will enable you to continue to learn and thrive.
3. **Be Kind to yourself** - Remember it is okay to have challenges and you will not get everything right straight away. Know this is not a reflection on you and is just a *part of the process* of learning. Think about what you would say to your friend in your position and tell that to yourself!

### A little about me

My name is Katy and I am currently completing a Full Stack MERN bootcamp with Tech Educators.  
My previous experience includes working as a Teaching Assistant and supporting people with additional needs.  
I am looking to change careers and to become a Junior Developer. In the future, I would love to combine my passion for Web Development and Education by working on projects that support learning and those with additional needs. 

My other hobbies and interests include:
- Musical Theatre
