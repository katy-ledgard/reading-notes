## Learn CSS - Flexbox

**Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.**  
This means that it can only deal with layouts in a single direction at a time - either a in a column or a row.

**Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.**  
The main axis is the direction of flex. If you have a flex-direction of row, then the main axis will be horizonatal (across the row) and the cross axis will vertical (the coloumn.) However, if you have a flex-direction of coloum; then the column (vertically) will be the main axis, and the row (horizontally) will be the cross axis. If unspecified, the flex-direction will be row by default, making that the main axis.  
On the main axis, flex items move as a group. On the cross axis, they can be moved either on their own or as a group.

**How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?**  
Using the flex-direction of row-reverse or column-reverse can negatively impact accessibility as when they re-order, it only affects the visual order rather than the logical order (such as that of the html or the DOM) and screenreaders will read the logical order rather than the visual order. Anything else which changes the order of items can cause this problem.  
The 'order' property is another example of this.


## CSS Layout - Flexbox


**What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?**  
You can do a lot more with flex. For one, flex gives more options for alignment; with the justify and align properties; you can position elements at the start, end, center, space-around, space-between and space evenly; where as with float you can only have left/right or start/end. Flex is also responsive amd dynamic, and it gives you the options to have content grow and shrink to fit the viewport. Flexbox also supports nesting of elements and containers. Flex makes re-ordering elements easy, although you should be careful doing this as it could effect accessibility.

**How does this topic connect with your long term goals?**  
This topic connects well as it will be very useful when creating apps and websites or working as a Junior Developer. It will make aligning items easier and help me to create dynamic and responsive pages.
