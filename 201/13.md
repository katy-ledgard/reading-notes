## Local Storage and How To Use It On Websites

**Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?**  
HTTP is stateless, which means that when an aplication is closed - the app/site will reset itself. Therefore you need to find somewhere to store the state somewhere, and this is sometimes done through local storage; such as with cookies or cache.  
A developer may use local storage if they have large amounts of information that do not change very often - instead of having to reload the content, by using local storage you could save a chache on local storage and it will brinf the content up quicker.

**What information should not be stored in local storage?**  
Sensitive information such as passwords, personal infomation etc should not be stored in local storage. 

**Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?**  
Strings. To convert data to strings, you would need to use the JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() methods. 
JSON.stringify() -  converts data into a string. Use this when setting an item (localStorage.setItem) to local storage.
JSON.parse() -   converts string back to data. Use this when getting an item (localStorage.getItem) from local storage.

>var car = {};  
car.wheels = 4;  
car.doors = 2;  
car.sound = 'vroom';  
car.name = 'Lightning McQueen';  
console.log( car );  
localStorage.setItem( 'car', JSON.stringify(car) );  
console.log( JSON.parse( localStorage.getItem( 'car' ) ) );
