**What is HTML and why do we use it?**  
HTML stands for "HyperText Markup Language". It is a AMrkuo language that is used to build webpages. HTML gives meaning to your content and signifies how it is structured. 

**What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?**  
There are 3 main parts of an element. These are:
1. The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element, wrapped in angle brackets '<>'.  
Eg. "< p >" (without the spaces).
2. The closing tag: This consists of the name of the element wrapped in angle brackets, except it has a forward slash before the element name to close the tag.  
Eg. < /p > (without the saces).  
*Note: Some elements are self closing, such as the img element.*
3. Content: This is as it implies, the content of the element. In a h1 or p tag, this would be text. In an img, this would be the img source/path.

**What is it called when you give an element extra information?**  
When you give an element extra information, this is called an 'attribute'.

**What is a semantic element?**  
A semantic element tells the browser what to expect, and what the meaning of the code is. Some elements are a semantic element, such as the h1 tag as it tells the browser that the text is the heading and important to the content of the page.
