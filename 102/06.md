**What are variables in JavaScript?**  
Variables are containers for storing data.

**What does it mean to declare a variable?**  
If you declare a variable, it essentially means you are creating a variabe. This can be done by using 'var', 'const' and 'let'. Var is the old way and should only be used when supporting old browsers. 'const' is used when the value should not be changed and 'let' is used otherwise.  
Eg: let x = 8; 

**What is an “assignment” operator, and what does it do?**  
The assignment operator is used to assign a value to a variable. It is done using the equals sign "=". In the above example, the assignment operator "=" is assigning the value of 8 to the variable 'x'.

**What is information received from the user called?**  
Information received from the user is called 'input'.
