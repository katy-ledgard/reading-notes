**What is the purpose of CSS?**  
CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets" and it allows you to style your content. If HTML is the structure or framework of a house, CSS would be how the house is decorated!

**What are the three ways to insert CSS into your project?**  
1. External CSS: The first and best way to add CSS to your project is to make a seperate CSS file (ending with the .css extension) and link it in the head of your HTML page using < link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" >.
2. Internal CSS: This is where you add the CSS styling within the head section of your HTML file itself. This is done using the style element inside the head element.
3. Inline CSS: This is used to add styling to a single element within your HTML.   
E.g. < p style="color:blue;" >This is a paragraph.</ p> would turn jus this paragraph blue.  
*Note: This is not best practise and should be used sparingly.*

**Write an example of a CSS rule that would give all < p > elements red text.**  
In the CSS file:  
p {  
    color: red;  
}
