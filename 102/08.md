**What is an expression in JavaScript?**  
An expression is a unit or section of code that can produce or evaluate a value.  

**Why would we use a loop in our code?**
Loops are useful when coding because it gives us a way to do something repeatedly without having to duplicate code. They can be written to do something a specific number of times of infinitely (It is common to get stuck in an infinite loop!).

**When does a for loop stop executing?**
A for loop is written to keep repeating an action until the condition that has been specified is evaluated or returned as false.

**How many times will a while loop execute?**  
A while loop will execute statements as long as the condition that has been specified evaluates or return as true.  
When the condition returns as false, the current statement will stop executing and move onto the next statement.
